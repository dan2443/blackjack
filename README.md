# blackjack
My goal in this project was to program the known casino game Blackjack as close to reality as possible. To reach that goal I implemented the rules of the game by following this website's explanation:

I decided to use JavaFX as my interface.

To run this project you will need to add JavaFX libraries to your project. If you are using Eclipse as me, use this guide:

## How the game looks

Top side of the window is dedicated to the player's cards on deck and bottom side to the dealer's. In addition, you have buttons on the bottom to decide your next move or to restart the game.

If the game is over, a popup will tell you the results and let you decide if you want to play again or to exit the program:
